Path Traversal Tips

Always try path traversal sequences using both forward slashes and backslashes. Many input filters check for only one of these, when the filesystem may support both. 2. Try simple URL-encoded representations of traversal sequences using the following encodings. Be sure to encode every single slash and dot within your input:

Dot — %2e
Forward slash — %2f
Backslash — %5c
Try using 16-bit Unicode encoding:
Dot — %u002e
Forward slash — %u2215
Backslash — %u2216
Try double URL encoding:
Dot — %252e
Forward slash — %252f
Backslash — %255c
Try overlong UTF-8 Unicode encoding:
Dot — %c0%2e, %e0%40%ae, %c0ae, and so on
Forward slash — %c0%af, %e0%80%af, %c0%2f, and so on
Backslash — %c0%5c, %c0%80%5c, and so on You can use the illegal Unicode payload type within Burp Intruder to generate a huge number of alternate representations of any given character and submit this at the relevant place within your target parameter. These representations strictly violate the rules for Unicode representation but nevertheless are accepted by many implementations of Unicode decoders, particularly on the Windows platform.
If the application is attempting to sanitize user input by removing traversal sequences and does not apply this filter recursively, it may be possible to bypass the filter by placing one sequence within another.
For example:
....//
..../
....\
..../\
